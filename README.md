# Project Name

## Introduction
This project is used for training and validating neural process models and diffusion models for air quality data.

## Environment Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch >= 1.8
- numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tqdm, pyyaml

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch numpy pandas scikit-learn tqdm pyyaml
```

## Data Preparation
Place the data in the corresponding subfolder under the `data/` directory (e.g., `data/bjair2017/`).

## Model Training and Validation
This process introduces how to complete the pre-training of the neural process model, the training of the diffusion model, and testing and validation.
